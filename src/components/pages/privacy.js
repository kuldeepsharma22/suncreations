<h2>How Sun Creation Utilises Information:</h2>
If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to us through the Sun Creation Platforms, we employ your personal details to operate, maintain, and furnish you with the features and functionalities of the Sun Creation Platforms.

Please note that any personal information, videos, images, audio clips, snaps, or similar content that you willingly disclose online (such as on discussion boards, in messages, chat areas, forums, public profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly accessible and can be gathered and utilized by others. Your account name (excluding your email address) is visible to other Users when you upload videos or send messages on the Sun Creation Platforms, allowing them to connect with you through uploads, messages, and comments.

Nevertheless, we might use your email address for non-marketing or administrative reasons (e.g., notifying you of significant Sun Creation Site updates or for customer service purposes).

Both your personally identifiable information and specific non-personally identifiable data (like anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser types, clickstream data, etc.) are utilized to enhance the quality and design of the Sun Creation Platforms. Additionally, they aid with the creation of new features, campaigns, services, and functionalities. This entails archiving, tracking, and examining user trends and preferences.

We use log file information, clear GIFs, and cookies in a number of ways to accomplish these aims, including: (a) to remember data, reducing the need for re-entry during your visit or subsequent visits to the Sun Creation Platforms; (b) to offer personalized content; (c) to evaluate the efficiency of our marketing campaigns; (d) to monitor aggregate metrics such as total visitor count and pages viewed; and (e) to track your participation, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable data to third parties. This kind of data is utilised for analytical purposes, such as evaluating user trends and improving the Sun Creation experience, and doesn't expose specific individuals.

It's important to note that any content you voluntarily disclose on public areas of the Sun Creation Platforms, such as discussion boards or forums, becomes publicly available and can be accessed by others. Furthermore, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information might be given to the acquiring business to maintain service continuity.
